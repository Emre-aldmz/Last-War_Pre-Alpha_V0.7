## 📜 STORY (Hikaye)

### LAST WAR: Symphony of the Ages

Here is the English translation, crafted to fit the atmospheric and dramatic tone of your game story:

The world is no longer whole. Civilization was shattered by the apocalypse known as 'The Great Silence,' leaving behind only three things: An obsessive desire for order, uncontrolled madness, and a bloody romance.

Upon the ruins of old cities, the 'Arena' was established—a place where ideologies take flesh and bone. This is not merely a battlefield; it is the final tribunal where it is determined whose reality will survive.
